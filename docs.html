      <h2>1. Dataset</h2>
      <p>
        I used the public <strong>Starbucks drink menu nutrition</strong> dataset
        from Kaggle. It contains nutrition information for different Starbucks
        drinks and sizes. I focused on a subset of attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="code">Beverage_category</span> – drink category (e.g., Coffee, Frappuccino).</li>
        <li><span class="code">Beverage</span> – drink name.</li>
        <li><span class="code">Beverage_prep</span> – preparation / size description.</li>
        <li><span class="code">Calories</span> – calories per serving.</li>
        <li><span class="code">Sugars (g)</span> – sugar in grams.</li>
        <li><span class="code">Caffeine (mg)</span> – caffeine in milligrams (when present).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Design process</h2>
      <p>
        My main question was: <em>“How do calories and sugar relate across different Starbucks drink categories?”</em>
        I also wanted to see which drinks are both very sugary and high in calories, and how caffeine fits into the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with quick pencil sketches of different options: one idea was multiple small bar charts
        per category, and another was a single scatterplot with filters. I decided to go with a scatterplot
        because it makes it easier to see the relationship between two continuous variables (calories and sugar).
      </p>
      <p>
        I also sketched the layout: controls at the top, the main chart on the left, and a short “How to read”
        panel on the right so the page still feels like a dashboard and not just a naked chart.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Visualization & interactions</h2>
      <p>The main visualization is a scatterplot with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>X‑axis:</strong> Calories</li>
        <li><strong>Y‑axis:</strong> Sugar (grams)</li>
        <li><strong>Point color:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>By default: drink <strong>category</strong> (categorical colors).</li>
            <li>Optional: <strong>caffeine level</strong>, using a yellow→red gradient.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Interactions:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Category dropdown to filter to a single drink type or see all.</li>
            <li>Slider to limit the maximum calories (e.g., “show me drinks under 300 calories”).</li>
            <li>Dropdown to switch color encoding from category to caffeine level.</li>
            <li>Tooltips on hover showing full drink name, prep, calories, sugar, and caffeine.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I capped the slider at 600 calories to avoid one or two extreme drinks stretching the scale too much.
        This keeps the chart visually stable even when you move the slider.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Design choices & rationale</h2>
      <h3>4.1 Encoding</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scatterplot:</strong> Chosen because it directly supports my main analytical task:
          visually comparing calories versus sugar.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Color:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Category colors use D3’s <span class="code">schemeTableau10</span>, which is colorblind‑friendly and readable.</li>
            <li>Caffeine uses a sequential yellow→red scale so “hotter” colors feel like higher caffeine.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tooltip:</strong> Instead of labeling points directly (which would be messy), I kept labels in a hover tooltip.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4.2 Layout</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Controls live in a horizontal strip at the top so they feel like filters for the whole view.
        </li>
        <li>
          The explanatory notes on the right help a casual user understand what the chart is doing
          without needing to read the assignment.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Findings</h2>
      <p>Using the visualization I noticed several patterns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Many Frappuccino‑style drinks cluster in the high‑calorie, high‑sugar top‑right of the chart.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brewed coffee and plain espresso drinks are usually very low in both calories and sugar unless they’re mixed with milk and syrups.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some drinks are high in sugar but not especially high in caffeine, which is easy to see when coloring by caffeine level.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These patterns are the kind of relationship that would be tedious to dig out from rows in a spreadsheet,
        but they become obvious once you can filter and hover through the scatterplot.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Demo video</h2>
      <p>
        Below is a short screen‑capture video where I walk through the visualization, explain the controls, and
        show a few example findings.
